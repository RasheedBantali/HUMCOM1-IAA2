        The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching.

        <p style="font-family: Georgia"><i>The game takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. 
            The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. 
            The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.</p></i></article>

        <p style="font-family:Gerogia; color:rgb(255, 217, 0);font: size 14px;"><i>Development took place between 2017 to 2020.
             Genshin Impact was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Android, and iOS in September 2020, with a PlayStation 5 released in April 2021, and is planned for a future release on Nintendo Switch.
             The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and open-world immersiveness, while others criticized its simplistic endgame and monetization model.
             A commercial success, the game grossed more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game.</i></p>

        <p style="font-family:Georgia;color:rgb(219, 235, 4);font-size: 16px;"><i> Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party.
            Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks.
            Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips.
            In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, such as Stormterror and the Electro Hypostasis, but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time.
            Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level.
            The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.</i></p>
