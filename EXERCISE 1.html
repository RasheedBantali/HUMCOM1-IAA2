<p style="font-family:Georgia">An eleven year old boy, Harry Potter, who lives with his uncle, aunt and cousin, having lost his parents as an infant, finds out that he’s a wizard and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
	There he makes many friends, the best of them being Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. A new teacher at the school that year is possessed by Lord Voldemort,
	 the antagonist of the series, who partially lost his life when he failed to kill baby-Harry (difficult to explain in short).
	 He tries to steal a stone that’s guarded by the headmaster of the school, Albus Dumbledore, because it’s an elixir of life. It’s up to the trio to try and stop him. </p>
